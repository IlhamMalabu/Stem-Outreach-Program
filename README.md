# Stem-Outreach-Program

This program was initiated during my tenure as the chairman for IEEE (AUN Chapter). 
The programs aim was to inspire and educate high school students around Yola, Adamawa about careers in STEM. The program included programming workshops and seminars.
The programming workshops were held over three weeks teaching fundamentals in HTML/CSS and Javascript.
The Seminar focused on Motivation, Creativity and Innovation. These are key in a pursuit of a STEM Career.
The outcome of the program was successful with students reporting back that their perception of STEM had cheanged positively.
